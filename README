Game Engine

Note: There's still something weird going on with my textures.
Some textured files load fine. Others load weird.

To compile, run the following command:

$: make

To run the compiled program, use the following command:

$: ./engine

This will run a program that draws 4 textured crates. You may move around
the world. There is no collision detection.
